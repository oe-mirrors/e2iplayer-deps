Native helper binaries and the C subtitle parser bundled with
[E2iPlayer](https://github.com/oe-mirrors/e2iplayer). Shipped as the
`enigma2-plugin-extensions-e2iplayer-deps` package, built from the
OE/OpenATV feed recipe.

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for how to build the components outside the
OE feed.

---

## lsdir

Fast directory lister used by the plugin's file browser. `lsdir --version`
prints the version string.

## cmdwrap

Command-line argument splitter.

## e2isubparser

Python C-extension for text subtitle parsing (SRT / SSA / TTML / EBU-TT).
The TTML path uses a vendored [Expat](https://libexpat.github.io/).

## f4mdump

Simple F4M / HDS (Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming) dumper. It shells out to
`wget` for the transfers rather than linking an HTTP library.

```
List bitrates:  f4mdump "/path/to/wget [extra params]" "http://url.to/Manifest.f4m"
Download:       f4mdump "/path/to/wget [extra params]" "http://url.to/Manifest.f4m" "/path/to/outfile" [bitrate]
```

## hlsdl

Downloads VOD and live HLS (`.m3u8`) streams to a single file. Handles
MPEG-2 Transport Stream and fragmented MP4 / CMAF segments, `EXT-X-MAP`
initialization segments (fMP4 and TS), `EXT-X-BYTERANGE`, discontinuities,
and AES-128 / SAMPLE-AES decryption.

Requires `libcurl` and `libcrypto`.

```
Linux:    make && make install && make clean
Windows:  hlsdl/msvc/BUID_WINDOWS.txt
```

### Usage

`hlsdl [options] url`

```
-b ... Automatically choose the best quality.
-W ... Choose largest width lower or equal than this.
-H ... Choose largest height lower or equal than this.
-A ... Select audio language.
-v ... Verbose more information.
-q ... Print less to the console.
-o ... Choose name of output file ("-" alias for stdout).
-f ... Force overwriting the output file.
-F ... Force ignore detection of DRM.
-u ... Set custom HTTP User-Agent header.
-h ... Set custom HTTP header.
-p ... Set proxy uri.
-C ... Cookie file (old Netscape / Mozilla format).
-k ... Allow to replace part of AES key uri - old.
-n ... Allow to replace part of AES key uri - new.
-K ... Force AES key value (hexstring).
-d ... Print the openssl decryption command.
-t ... Print the links to the .ts files.
-s ... Set live start offset in seconds.
-i ... Set live stream download duration in seconds.
-e ... Set refresh delay in seconds.
-r ... Set max retries at open.
-w ... Set max download segment retries.
-a ... Set additional url to the audio media playlist.
-c ... Treat HTTP 206 as 200 even without a range request.
```

Not handled (E2iPlayer routes these through its own ffmpeg/gstreamer
pipeline): Widevine / PlayReady / FairPlay (CENC / cbcs), real muxing, and
bit-exact remuxing across codec parameter changes.
