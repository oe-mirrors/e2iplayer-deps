Native helper binaries and the C subtitle parser bundled with
[E2iPlayer](https://github.com/oe-mirrors/e2iplayer). Shipped as the
`enigma2-plugin-extensions-e2iplayer-deps` package, built from the
OE/OpenATV feed recipe.

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for how to build the components outside the
OE feed.

---

## lsdir

Fast directory lister used by the plugin's file browser. `lsdir --version`
prints the version string.

## cmdwrap

Command-line argument splitter.

## e2ipow

Proof of work solvers, the native versions of E2iPlayer's Python solvers
(about a hundred times faster on the box). The first argument picks the
algorithm, `e2ipow --list` prints the supported ones, `e2ipow --version`
the version string. Exit codes: 0 solved, 1 internal error, 2 usage or
unknown algorithm, 3 time limit reached.

```
e2ipow byse <pow_nonce> <difficulty> <start> <step> <timeout seconds>
-> {"solution": "<counter>" or null, "hashes": <tried>}
   Byse video player, same arguments and output as scripts/bysepow.py
```

## exteplayer3png

PNG writer plugin of exteplayer3 (`/usr/lib/exteplayer3png.so`, needs
libpng). exteplayer3 loads it with `dlopen()` when it runs with
`-G <directory>` and saves graphic subtitles (PGS / DVB / XSUB) there as PNG
files; without the plugin those subtitle tracks cannot be shown.

## e2isubparser

Python C-extension for text subtitle parsing (SRT / SSA / TTML / EBU-TT).
The TTML path uses a vendored [Expat](https://libexpat.github.io/) 2.8.5
(`e2isubparser/src/expat`, the `lib/` sources of the release tarball).

## f4mdump

Simple F4M / HDS (Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming) dumper. It shells out to
`wget` for the transfers rather than linking an HTTP library.

```
List bitrates:  f4mdump "/path/to/wget [extra params]" "http://url.to/Manifest.f4m"
Download:       f4mdump "/path/to/wget [extra params]" "http://url.to/Manifest.f4m" "/path/to/outfile" [bitrate]
```

## hlsdl

Downloads VOD and live HLS (`.m3u8`) streams to a single file. Handles
MPEG-2 Transport Stream and fragmented MP4 / CMAF segments, `EXT-X-MAP`
initialization segments (fMP4 and TS; a repeated map is written once, a new
one after a discontinuity also in live streams), `EXT-X-BYTERANGE`, discontinuities,
AES-128 / SAMPLE-AES decryption (each segment with the key, IV and method -
including `METHOD=NONE` - in force where it stands), and TS segments disguised
as images (an image header in front of the MPEG-TS data is cut off).
`EXT-X-KEY` and `EXT-X-MAP` attributes may come in any order. A segment that
cannot be fetched (an empty body counts as failed), decrypted or written fails
a VOD download (exit code 1, resumable with `-R`), as does an init segment
whose response does not match its `BYTERANGE`; with `-I` a VOD download skips
segments that cannot be fetched (decryption and write errors stay fatal). A live download skips a
segment it cannot fetch or decrypt and stops when the output cannot be written.
A separate audio rendition (`EXT-X-MEDIA TYPE=AUDIO` or `-a`, TS or packed
audio with an ID3 timestamp) is muxed into TS output for VOD and live streams;
with fMP4 the video track is written alone.

Requires `libcurl` and `libcrypto`.

```
Linux:    make && make install && make clean
Windows:  hlsdl/msvc/BUID_WINDOWS.txt
```

### Usage

`hlsdl [options] url`

```
-b ... Automatically choose the best quality.
-W ... Choose largest width lower or equal than this.
-H ... Choose largest height lower or equal than this.
-A ... Select audio language.
-v ... Verbose more information.
-q ... Print less to the console (status lines, errors and warnings; -qq: nothing).
-o ... Choose name of output file ("-" alias for stdout).
-f ... Force overwriting the output file.
-R ... Resume an interrupted VOD download (keeps a <output>.hlsdl.resume sidecar).
-F ... Force ignore detection of DRM.
-u ... Set custom HTTP User-Agent header.
-h ... Set custom HTTP header.
-p ... Set proxy uri.
-C ... Cookie file (old Netscape / Mozilla format).
-k ... Allow to replace part of AES key uri - old.
-n ... Allow to replace part of AES key uri - new.
-K ... Force AES key value (hexstring).
-d ... Print the openssl decryption command.
-t ... Print the links to the .ts files.
-s ... Set live start offset in seconds.
-i ... Set live stream download duration in seconds.
-e ... Set refresh delay in seconds.
-r ... Set max retries at open.
-w ... Set max download segment retries.
-I ... Skip VOD segments that still fail after the retries (the output has gaps; not with -R).
-a ... Set additional url to the audio media playlist (VOD and live, TS only).
-c ... Treat HTTP 206 as 200 even without a range request.
```

Not handled (E2iPlayer routes these through its own ffmpeg/gstreamer
pipeline): Widevine / PlayReady / FairPlay (CENC / cbcs), real muxing, and
bit-exact remuxing across codec parameter changes.
